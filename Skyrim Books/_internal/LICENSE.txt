Skyrim Books License, Version 1

(derived from PSF License v2.0, http://opensource.org/licenses/Python-2.0 and Digsby License)

1. This humble program serves merely as a technical exercise and you are free to use this software to if you are so inclined, although you are not free to edit it in any way, shape or form. I shall not be liable for any negative consequences experienced by Licensee's that otherwise modify, distribute and/or use this any modified version of it 

2. While I do not believe that it is possible for this program to be used for nefarious purposes in anything resembling its current form, by agreeing to this, you pinky promise not to use it for evil, even if you do find a way to do so without alterations. If you do, I will know, and I will cry!

3. While the majority of this program was created by yours truly, the functions to sort the treeview and add the custom fonts are from the Tkinter tk demo and from "https://github.com/ifwe/digsby/blob/f5fe00244744aa131e07f09348d10563f3d8fa99/digsby/src/gui/native/win/winfonts.py#L15" respectively, with the latter being licensed from Digsby and Tagged, Inc. (see below).

IN COMPLIANCE WITH DIGSBY LICENSE PARAGRAPH 3, THE LIST OF CHANGES IS AS FOLLOWS:
	1) MOVED THE SOURCE OF THE FUNCTION FROM THE MIDDLE TO JUST ABOVE THIS LIST
	2) MOVED AND IMPLEMENTED THE FOLLOWING INSTRUCTIONS - # This function is written for Python 2.x. For 3.x, you have to convert the isinstance checks to bytes and str
	3) REMOVED SOME EMPTY LINES

4. The fonts used within this program were taken from "The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim" and belong to Bethesda (Please don't sue me, 'O Wise and Benevolent Lord Howard, I mean no offense, my Liege! I seek only to show my love and appreciation for you and your masterpiece with this humble program!)

5. This License Agreement will automatically terminate upon a material breach of its terms and conditions.

6. By copying, installing or otherwise using Skyrim Books, Licensee agrees to be bound by the terms and conditions of this License Agreement.
